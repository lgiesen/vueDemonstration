Hence, only the two most influential ones will be presented (Design Languages - Discover Best Design Languages and Design Systems, n.d.).Firstly, Google’s Material Theme is very popular and can be used with the front-end libraries Materialize.css or Vuetify, where the latter is especially suitable for Vue.js. The Material design guidelines offer a comprehensive and very detailed guide to web and mobile design. It is stressed that a website needs to be informative, honest and reassuring. Thus, intuitiveness, functionality, understandability and authenticity are provided, and an atmosphere of comfort and security is created. The key idea is to imitate real life physics, e.g. shadow is cast by key and ambient light and altered by elevation to the underlying material instead of changing the use of color. User Input may change elevation so that “components move to preset dynamic elevation offset“ (Elevation - Material Design, n.d.) and a three dimensional effect is created. The material layout uses three principles: First, the layout needs to be predictable. Secondly, there needs to be a consistency in design in form of a repeating grid, harmonious keylines and padding. Thirdly, responsiveness is essential because mobile and desktop devices are used by consumers. Thence, columns, gutters and margins are used to guarantee a responsive design. https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html# Moreover, further details are explained in the guidelines about different types of navigation and parameters for choosing a color palette (consisting of a primary and secondary color and variants of both) are accentuated. Lastly, Google offers a type scale generator and explain how sound, icons, shape and motion are used in Material Design system should be defined.Apple’s design guidelines use clarity, deference and depth rules for their themes. In detail that accentuates that text is readably and components are displayed in a clean fashion. Blur and a minimalistic approach to gradients and shadows has an attentive effect and create depth and a layered UI.Apple’s design principles lead to a great presentation of its brand. First, they comprise aesthetic integrity, which underlines how UI impression and behavior replenish and enrich its functionality. Second, there is a focus on consistency, e.g. the use of familiar icons, interface components and unequivocal terminology. Third, direct manipulation involves the user in interaction. Hence UX is enhanced through device rotation and gestures. Fourth, feedback in the case of progress bars or hover and click effects keeps the user engaged. Fifth, metaphors sparks interest by provided real life concepts, for instance toggle switches, drag and drop content or digital pages of books. Sixth, user control is provided by guiding the user, who ultimately decides (Human Interface Guidelines - Design - Apple Developer, n.d.; Themes - IOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer, n.d.).")]),a("h2",[e._v("Design Principles and Theory")]),a("p",[e._v("Standardization of terminology (for use cases) facilitate development and reduce thefrequency and extent of impact of misunderstandings (Tena et al., 2013).
