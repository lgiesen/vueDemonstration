      h1 Design Languages
      p There are various design languages, for instance Lighting Design System 
        | by Salesforce, Polaris by Shopify, Living Language by IBM and many more.
        | Hence, only the two most influential ones will be presented (Design Languages
        | - Discover Best Design Languages and Design Systems, n.d.).Firstly, Google’s
        | Material Theme is very popular and can be used with the front-end libraries
        | Materialize.css or Vuetify, where the latter is especially suitable for Vue.js.
        |The Material design guidelines offer a comprehensive and very detailed guide to
        | web and mobile design. It is stressed that a website needs to be informative,
        | honest and reassuring. Thus, intuitiveness, functionality, understandability
        | and authenticity are provided, and an atmosphere of comfort and security is
        | created. The key idea is to imitate real life physics, e.g. shadow is cast by
        | key and ambient light and altered by elevation to the underlying material
        | instead of changing the use of color. User Input may change elevation so that
        | “components move to preset dynamic elevation offset“ (Elevation - Material
        | Design, n.d.) and a three dimensional effect is created.  The material layout
        | uses three principles: First, the layout needs to be predictable. Secondly,
        | there needs to be a consistency in design in form of a repeating grid,
        | harmonious keylines and padding. Thirdly, responsiveness is essential because
        | mobile and desktop devices are used by consumers. Thence, columns, gutters and
        | margins are used to guarantee a responsive design.

        |Moreover, further details are explained in the guidelines about different types
        | of navigation and parameters for choosing a color palette (consisting of a
        | primary and secondary color and variants of both) are accentuated. Lastly,
        | Google offers a type scale generator and explain how sound, icons, shape and
        | motion are used in Material Design system should be defined.Apple’s design
        | guidelines use clarity, deference and depth rules for their themes. In detail
        | that accentuates that text is readably and components are displayed in a clean
        | fashion. Blur and a minimalistic approach to gradients and shadows has an
        | attentive effect and create depth and a layered UI.Apple’s design principles
        | lead to a great presentation of its brand. First, they comprise aesthetic
        | integrity, which underlines how UI impression and behavior replenish and enrich
        | its functionality. Second, there is a focus on consistency, e.g. the use of
        | familiar icons, interface components and unequivocal terminology. Third, direct
        | manipulation involves the user in interaction. Hence UX is enhanced through
        | device rotation and gestures. Fourth, feedback in the case of progress bars or
        | hover and click effects keeps the user engaged. Fifth, metaphors sparks interest
        | by provided real life concepts, for instance toggle switches, drag and drop
        | content or digital pages of books. Sixth, user control is provided by guiding the
        | user, who ultimately decides (Human Interface Guidelines - Design - Apple Developer,
        | n.d.; Themes - IOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer, n.d.).
      h1 Design Principles and Theory
      p Standardization of terminology (for use cases) facilitate development and reduce the
        | frequency and extent of impact of misunderstandings (Tena et al., 2013). This idea
        | for example takes on shape in the predefined methods, e.g. the functionality of
        | filter() is commonly known.
