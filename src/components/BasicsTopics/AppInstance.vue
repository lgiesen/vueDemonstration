            p The Vue or application instance in @/main.js lies at the heart of every Vue Application 
                | because it is created with central options and dependencies, which determine how the 
                | front-end is realized. During its mounting process, all properties are loaded in Vueâ€™s 
                | reactivity system allowing a dynamic and reactive use of data, i.e. if a variable is 
                | changed, all components, who use that variable are updated. (Vue, n.d.-c).
