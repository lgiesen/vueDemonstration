        more complex logic and reoccurrence of the same calculation. Even though, 
        methods and computed properties return the same result, the latter checks the 
        cache, if a recalculation needs to be performed. Hence, computed properties 
        are updated when a property changes, but methods are not updated after they 
        have been called (Computed Properties and Watchers â€” Vue.Js, n.d.).`
